# This repo demonstrates a minimal Teams video app.

## Develop video app in local and debug it in test-app

1. Clone this repo  and open terminal.
2. `cd` to the directory of README.md.
3. run `yarn install`.
4. run `yarn dev`, this will host the app in local environment or you can host the `src` folder on other place can access.
5. copy `https://127.0.0.1:5173/` or URL if you host on the place to test-app 'Video app url' input box and then click 'Load' button.
6. change `videoFrameHandler` function in `src/index.js`
7. This sample processes the video frame in main thread for simplicity, you can move the frame processing to worker thread if needed.


## Teams Video API reference
#### You can find the Teams video extensibility API [link](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-library-js/blob/master/src/public/video.ts)

### API reference
There are three API for video extensibility
```javascript
registerForVideoFrame(frameCallback, config) 
```
#### Register a callback to get: 
- video frames from video pipeline.
- a callback to return processed video frames to video pipeline. 
- a callback to notify error 

```javascript
registerForVideoEffect(callback)
```
- Get notification that the selected effect in video appâ€™s UI should be applied
```javascript
 notifySelectedVideoEffectChanged(
    effectChangeType,
    effectId,
  ) 
  ```
  - Whenever the user selects a different effect in a video app, the video app should call this API to notify Teams client. 
## How to use the test app?


1. Test-app was used to develop/verify video app, you can find the test-app under the `test-app` folder, copy and unzip to other folder. Ensure you are in Windows, and your computer has a camera. Use OBS virtual camera if you don't have a camera.
1. After the application is opened, select a camera device in the 'Camera' drop down.
1. Input your video app's URL. Deploying the video app in https server is preferred.
1. Click `Load video app`. The sample video app will be loaded if the `Video app url` is blank.

## How to test performance?

1. Load video app following commands in the above section.
2. To evaluate processing time, click `Real-time Evaluation` or `Full Evaluation` under `Time per Frame'. 
    - `Real-time Evaluation` logs the average and range of processing time in millisecond in each second.
    - `Full Evaluation` logs both the processing time and the distribution of processing time.
3. To evaluate memory usage, click `Real-time Evaluation` or `Full Evaluation` under `Memory Usage'. 
    - `Real-time Evaluation` logs the average and range of both active heap size and total heap size for each frame.
    - `Full Evaluation` logs both the heap size and the distribution of heap size.
4. To test video app under different resolutions, click `Reduce the resolution by half`, `Same`, or `Double the resolution`. 


## How to change to your own video app?

1. Click `Destroy video app` if you have already loaded the sample video app.
2. Input your video app's URL.
3. Click `Load video app`.

## How to change camera resolution?

We can change the video frame resolution by changing this configuration file: `%appdata%\Roaming\Microsoft\electron\SkypeRT\persistent.conf`

Please append the following key-value to the json file: `"RtmCodecsConfig": {"MinVideoSourceResolution":"83886800", "MaxVideoSourceResolution":"83886800"}`

Here are the allowed number corresponding to specific resolution:

```
(640, 360)   = 0x02800168 = 41943400
(1280, 720)  = 0x050002D0 = 83886800
(1920, 1080) = 0x07800438 = 125830200
```

After saving the persistent.conf, restart the test-app, it should grab video frame from camera with the given resolution.
 
The RtmCodecsConfig key-value will be removed every time restarting the test-app, it's expected. But the resolution will be remembered in the test-app future running.

## There's no device shown in the 'Camera' dropdown.

1. Make sure your camera has been plugged into your computer.
2. Delete `%appdata%\Microsoft\electron` folder.

## Install the video app in Teams
1. Host the app directory in a public accessible HTTPS server. You can use github page as the host.
2. Replace the `name`, `appId`, and `contentUrl` in `manifest/manifest.json`.
    1. The contentUrl should point to your app directory, like `https://github.com/microsoft/teams-videoapp-sample/app/`
    2. appId can be any unique GUID
3. zip the manifest directory, choose the zip file after clicking Upload a custom app
4. Go to a teams meeting, enable the video, and activate the video app.
5. You can get more information on [Video app developer guide](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-videoapp-sample/wiki/Teams-Video-App-Developer-Guide)
