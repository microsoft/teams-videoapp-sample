# This repo demonstrates a minimal Teams video app.

## Develop video app in local and debug it in test-app

1. Clone this repo  and open terminal.
2. `cd` to the directory of README.md.
3. run `yarn install`.
4. run `yarn dev`, this will host the app in local environment or you can host the `src` folder on other place can access.
5. copy `https://127.0.0.1:5173/` or URL if you host on the place to test-app 'Video app url' input box and then click 'Load' button.
6. change `videoFrameHandler` function in `src/index.js`
7. This sample processes the video frame in main thread for simplicity, you can move the frame processing to worker thread if needed.


## Teams Video API reference
#### You can find the Teams video extensibility API [link](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-library-js/blob/main/packages/teams-js/src/public/video.ts)

### API reference
There are three API for video extensibility
```javascript
registerForVideoFrame(frameCallback, config) 
```
#### Register a callback to get: 
- video frames from video pipeline.
- a callback to return processed video frames to video pipeline. 
- a callback to notify error 

```javascript
registerForVideoEffect(callback)
```
- Get notification that the selected effect in video appâ€™s UI should be applied
```javascript
 notifySelectedVideoEffectChanged(
    effectChangeType,
    effectId,
  ) 
  ```
  - Whenever the user selects a different effect in a video app, the video app should call this API to notify Teams client. 


## Sideload the video app in Teams
1. Host the app directory in a public accessible HTTPS server. You can use github page as the host.
2. Replace the `name`, `appId`, and `contentUrl` in `manifest/manifest.json`.
    1. The contentUrl should point to your app directory, like `https://github.com/microsoft/teams-videoapp-sample/app/`
    2. appId can be any unique GUID
3. zip the manifest directory, choose the zip file after clicking Upload a custom app
4. Go to a teams meeting, enable the video, and activate the video app.
5. You can get more information on [Video app developer guide](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-videoapp-sample/wiki/Teams-Video-App-Developer-Guide)
